`conio.h` is a header file available in C language that consist of some very useful built-in functions that you can use in your program. Before I tell you what are the functions available in conio.h, first lets us understand what is header file and why we use it our code.

A header file is file that consist many built-in functions of the language and macro definitions to be shared among many source files. There are two types of header files: first that are already comes with compiler and the other one are those that the programmers writes for an application.

The primary purpose of a header file is to propagate declarations to code files. Header files allow us to put declarations in one location and then import them wherever we need them.

conio.h file consists of following functions:

**clrscr():** This function is used to clear the output screen.

**getch():** It reads character from keyboard

**getche():** It reads character from keyboard and echoes to o/p screen

**textcolor():** This function is used to change the text color
